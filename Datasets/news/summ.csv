"This teacher straight up looks like a whole new person!As soon as his students walked into his classroom on the first day of school, it was clear that the summer had been very good to 34-year-old history teacher Mr. Keegan, who had managed to sprout up seven inches and lose his baby face since theyâ€™d last seen him in June."
"While passionate fans have been able to resurrect many shows after their cancellations, like Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Mindy Project, and A.P. Bio, the minds behind one show are pleading with their viewers to leave their program alone: The creators of Stranger Things are preemptively begging fans not to do a viral campaign to save the show when it gets canceled.Wow. Looks like the people who brought us Stranger Things really donâ€™t want to be trapped making the show forever.AdvertisementEarlier today, Matt and Ross Duffer, the showâ€™s creators, released the following statement asking everyone who enjoys Stranger Things to please avoid trying to save the show whenever Netflix decides not to renew it for another season:â€œWhile  weâ€™re currently busy working on the fourth season of our show Stranger Things, we find it necessary to say that when this show does get canceled, please, let it die."

"This prompted Mom to open a preliminary probe into whether or not the family was seated directly underneath an air conditioning vent, which indeed turned out to be the case, thus confirming Momâ€™s theory as to why frigid air was blasting straight down her neck and making her cold.AdvertisementMom then conclusively determined that the restaurant must be intentionally trying to make its customers freeze, her primary evidence being that â€œItâ€™s the middle of the summer and they know people will be wearing shorts and tank tops, yet they still insist on making it feel like Antarctica in here.â€ She also noted that â€œThis is exactly what happened when we came here last summer,â€ suggesting that this was not an isolated incident but rather a malicious, ongoing conspiracy aimed at making the customers who spend their hard-earned money feel miserable.â€œThe only explanation for why theyâ€™d turn this place into an icebox is that they want to see us shiver,â€ Mom deduced, adding that she didnâ€™t even want to drink the Diet Coke sheâ€™d ordered anymore because itâ€™d just make her colder."
"If you are a parent, then you know that it just doesnâ€™t get any better than this!AdvertisementBy an incredible stroke of luck, this moon bounce that was set up today at a neighborhood block party in Cedar Rapids, IA has absolutely zero pedophiles hopping around inside of it right now, allowing the children to bounce freely and safely while their parents watch on with the peace of mind that can only come from knowing your child isnâ€™t being targeted by evil sickos."
"Itâ€™s chilling to think what this would-be shooter might have been able to do had these two incredible students not spent the entire day getting weirdly physical with each other and blocking his access to his deadly assault weapons!AdvertisementFifteen-year-old Brian Robertson prepared to take the duffel bag full of guns heâ€™d stashed in his locker and begin a deadly attack on his fellow classmates, but was immediately thwarted by two goth kids kissing in front of his locker."
"Today, weâ€™ve got tale of romantic glamour that could only come from the beautiful city of gossip called Tinseltown and Hollywood: JoJo Siwa and Ken Bone have agreed that if theyâ€™re still single in 300 years, they will both marry Martin Short.Hooray for a marriage pact like no other!And when Martin Short picked up that phone, JoJo (ponytail) said, â€œWould you please become married to me and Ken Bone (red shirt) if neither of us are married in 300 years?â€ Well, get out your wedding vest, because sources say Martin Short muttered â€œokayâ€ and hung up the phone!It looks like Hollywoodâ€™s own Lin Manuel-Manuel got it right when he said, â€œLove is like marriage from Hollyweird!â€But before you try to order the fiancees a spatula from their wedding registry at Kohlâ€™s, keep in mind that itâ€™s entirely possible that these two starlets will meet other husbands and wives in the time between now and 300 years from now."
"Itâ€™s rare that there are so many great acts in a talent show that itâ€™s difficult to choose a winner, but thatâ€™s precisely the case in todayâ€™s competition at Timberlane Middle School in Pennington, New Jersey: The faculty members judging the talent show canâ€™t decide which of the fat-kid-and-janitor duos who tap-danced to Randy Newmanâ€™s â€œYouâ€™ve Got A Friend In Meâ€ should win first place.Wow. Looks like the grand prize could still belong to any one of the many fat-kid-and-janitor-singing partnerships!AdvertisementFrom the moment that the very first lonely-fat-kid-and-kindly-old-janitor duo strutted onstage to the opening notes of the iconic song from Toy Story, it was clear that their performance would be hard to beat."
"The summer carnival at St. Maryâ€™s Church in Grand Forks, ND is usually just a standard-fare church carnival consisting of small rides and basic games, but the church just upped the ante in a major way: They somehow managed to get an actual goddamn roller coaster this year.What!!"
"Itâ€™s tough to imagine anyone getting behind a movement intended to empower someone as unpleasant to be around as this god-awful woman.AdvertisementUnfortunately, itâ€™s difficult to extend any sisterly support to someone who sucks this much ass.Thereâ€™s no telling how far Sarah will set back the feminist cause over the course of her life, but her apparent commitment to using her bad personality to totally blow every personal and professional opportunity that comes her way suggests that she will continue giving women a bad name for the foreseeable future."
"Hip-hop superstar Drakeâ€™s loud presence on the sidelines of Toronto Raptors games has been a constant storyline of the 2019 NBA playoffs, but it looks like tonight heâ€™s stuck far away from the action: Drake forgot to buy courtside tickets for Game 5 and is now trying to act like heâ€™s friends with the Raptors from way up in the nosebleeds.Woof.DONâ€™T LEAVE ME HANGINâ€™, FELLAS!â€The scene only got more pathetic when Drake tried his reignite his beef with Warriors players by standing up on his chair and futilely attempting to get a â€œDRAYMOND STINKS!â€ chant going for five cringe-worthy minutes straight before a stadium attendant finally came over and asked him to sit down.Damn, looks like itâ€™s just not Drakeâ€™s night.While itâ€™d probably be best if Drake just accepted that heâ€™s too far away from the court to pal around with the Warriors tonight and just enjoyed the rest of the game in silence, it looks like heâ€™s completely unwilling to accept the nosebleeds experience."
"In recent years, itâ€™s become increasingly common for brands to put vintage labels on products in hopes of capitalizing on consumer nostalgia, and now it looks like a popular over-the-counter antacid is aiming to cash in on this trend with some throwback packaging of their own: Tums has released a commemorative 200th anniversary Tums bottle under the assumption that itâ€™s probably been 200 years of Tums by now.Sweet!"

"Kennedy remains one of the most shocking days in United States history, but now, for the first time in over 55 years, an incredible artifact from that devastating event will be put on display: The beautiful velvet ribbon that made John F.The ribbon, which famously remained snug around President Kennedyâ€™s neck from his birth until the moment it was untied on that fateful November day, has even been reshaped into a bow matching the circumference of JFKâ€™s neck to demonstrate just how he wore it, just how it was always supposed to remain...AdvertisementAmericans will never forget where they were when they heard about the terrible tragedy that had befallen John F.â€œMay I please untie the ribbon?â€ John turned away from her.And now, Smithsonian visitors finally have a chance to see the infamous ribbon up close!AdvertisementThe exhibit also includes the now-iconic photo of Jackie frantically attempting to climb out of the car to chase the head across the street after sheâ€™d accidentally bumped it into the road, as well as the heartbreaking broadcast by CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite in which he narrates the First Ladyâ€™s failed attempts to bring JFK back to life by putting the head back onto his body and re-tying the ribbon around his neck.Wow. Itâ€™s incredible to think how the course of the world would have been altered had Jackie simply accepted that the ribbon was JFKâ€™s ribbon and his ribbon alone, or if sheâ€™d understood that even in loveâ€”even in marriageâ€”some things must remain secret...undisturbed...AdvertisementIf youâ€™re interested in seeing the velvet ribbon for yourself, definitely plan a trip to D.C. ASAP for a glimpse at a piece of one of the most heartbreaking events in American history."
"Though the Islamic State has lost a great deal of its territory in the past year, its methods for attracting new members have only gotten more insidious: In one of its most aggressive recruitment tactics ever, ISIS has begun offering new members a free canvas tote bag when they join for a year.This is absolutely chilling."
"In recent months, the Trump administration has continued to apply pressure to the already contentious relationship between the U.S. and China, but the Presidentâ€™s latest maneuver may have just backfired in a major way: President Trumpâ€™s new ponytail is currently stuck in the White House fax machine after he tried to fax an image of it to Xi Jinping to make him jealous.Wow. This is a troubling situation with serious implications for national security.AdvertisementEarlier this week, President Trump debuted a dry, stringy new ponytail and immediately began using it to taunt his foreign adversaries, but with the ponytail now caught deep in a fax machine, it seems his hubris has only made things worse for him."
"Prepare to have your mind blown, because a medical procedure that was once the stuff of science fiction has finally become science fact: MIT scientists have successfully swapped the brain of a man with an almond.This is an incredible milestone for medical science!At 4:38 this morning, a team of neuroscientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology emerged from an operating room after 22 grueling hours of non-stop surgery to announce that they had successfully replaced a manâ€™s brain with a single dry-roasted almond for the first time in history."
"The U.S. State Department is hoping that President Trump can convince Queen Elizabeth to stop developing nuclear weapons in her attic.This meeting is a critical opportunity for Trump and Queen Elizabeth to diplomatically resolve this major threat to global peace.AdvertisementFor the past three decades, Queen Elizabeth has been frequently condemned by the international community for tinkering away night and day in her attic, developing nuclear weapons that the Royal Family could launch from the Buckingham Palace lawn."
"But there are also rare occasions when the universe sends us messages that are so unmistakably clear that they canâ€™t be ignored, and hereâ€™s a story of one such instance: The Instagram post announcing this coupleâ€™s engagement only has 16 likes and one spam comment.Yikes.This is a crystal-clear sign that they should probably call the whole thing off.AdvertisementAlthough itâ€™s been nearly 24 hours since Nashville resident Rachel Yorkman posted a smiling selfie with her boyfriend Derek Czapliki to announce their engagement, the post has racked up fewer likes than the blurry sunset photo she posted the day before, making it pretty damn obvious that this relationship just isnâ€™t meant to be."
"If you ask us, the only person on the planet who should be intimately familiar with the Auntie Anneâ€™s app is the web developer who created it.In order to get a free pretzel via the Pretzel Perks app, customers have to spend $25 at Auntie Anneâ€™sâ€”which makes it all the more disturbing that Jack uses this discount enough to justify keeping Pretzel Perks on the front page of his phone right next to the weather app."

"â€œAlright, we have 20 more minutes before you get to go to lunch, so would someone like to come up and read page 27 for usâ€”maybe someone from the back of the classroom?â€ said Fabacher, who, after taking way too long to give instructions, refused to call on a single student who raised their hand and instead chose a boy named Tommy, who she knew would reliably mispronounce any word with more than one syllable."
"â€œAfter we learned that the whistleblower is CIA, we figured it would be pretty quick to narrow down his identity among the few people there with a moral compass, but the more we looked into it, we realized we canâ€™t think of anybody who has one,â€ said Stephen Miller, adding that aides had cleared everyone with links to the intelligence community they knew had knowledge of Trumpâ€™s Ukraine conversations due to the fact that they were all too unethical and black-hearted to care about any presidential misconduct."
"Itâ€™s deeply reckless for Ukraine to push us towards investigating criminal behavior, especially so close to an election year, and we hope this resolution will put an end to that.â€ At press time, Pelosi had expressed her satisfaction that the bill had been approved after receiving widespread Republican support."

"Once I opened the gate, a few them just sprinted out and took a huge shit in right field.â€ At press time, Hottovy was attempting to console a whimpering Craig Kimbrel who had spent the entire game curled up in the corner of the bullpen.Advertisement"
"In May 2016, while she was employment minister and a Vote Leave campaigner, she said that â€œuncontrolled immigration from the EU has led to tougher controls on migrants from the rest of the world.By voting to leave we can take back control of our immigration policies, save our curry houses and join the rest of the world.â€ In fact the restrictions on curry chefs were brought in by the Conservatives in 2011: quite where the lost â€œcontrolâ€ of immigration policies went between 2011 and 2016 was not explained.This will hopefully, er, curry favour with disgruntled restaurant bosses who in 2017, a year after the Brexit vote, said they felt â€œbetrayedâ€ that ministers still hadnâ€™t done anything.Back then, immigration minister Robert Goodwill suggested the staff shortage could be dealt with by training curry chefs in Britain."
"Just a week after the last Eye outlined the murky (tax-dodging, business-screwing, oligarch-schmoozing) record of recently promoted Tory party co-treasurer Ehud â€œUdiâ€ Sheleg, the government announced his knighthood as Mayâ€™s parting gift to the nation.Resignation honours carry little explanation for the higher gongs; so all we know about Udiâ€™s K is that it rewards â€œpolitical and public serviceâ€.Even before he was ennobled last week, peerage-chasing Ranger had already made House of Lords history: having applied to be a â€œPeopleâ€™s Peerâ€ in 2007 and 2010, he tried the new tack in 2013 of suing the House of Lords Appointments Commission because it didnâ€™t select him!Yet, oddly, some stalwart supporters of Mayâ€™s deal do seem to have found themselves in her resignation honours anyway.John Mann, one of only three Labour MPs who loyally voted for Mayâ€™s deal three times, is now Lord Mann for his trouble.On the Conservative benches, this summerâ€™s short-lived chairman of the 1922 Committee, Charles Walker, had to represent backbenchers who were furious at Mayâ€™s deal; yet he had thrice voted for the same deal, and is now no doubt as surprised as everyone else to find himself a Knight Commander of the Bath.Then, of course, there were the honours for those loyal arm-twisters who did so much to flog the dead horse of Mayâ€™s premiership: a KCB for her de facto deputy, David Lidington; a CBE for chief whip Julian Lewis; a Companion of Honour for the already-knighted Conservative Party chairman, Sir Patrick McLoughlin; a CBE for his successor chairman, Brandon Lewis; and a senior knighthood (Kindly Call Me God) for Mayâ€™s parliamentary private secretary, George Hollingbery.All loyally voted for Mayâ€™s deal every time.In the weeks before May left Downing Street, the government was careful to avoid answering questions about whether any of her housing ministers had been questioned under caution by the Met Police in its inquiry into the fatal 2017 Grenfell Tower fire.Barwellâ€™s gong, like the CBE for fellow former housing minister Brandon Lewis (see above) came after another devastating fire destroyed a four-storey block of flats in south-west London this month â€“ raising fresh questions about timber-framed buildings following a similar disaster at a care home in Crewe last month.Companion of Honour Sir Patrick McLoughlinâ€™s gong (see above) managed to fly in the face of Mayâ€™s keynote vision for â€œa truly meritocratic Britain that puts the interests of ordinary, working class people firstâ€, as set out in a speech not long after she entered Downing Street.Jimmy was given his near hereditary honour for being Mayâ€™s â€œspecial adviser for business relationsâ€ from 2016 to 2019.â€œIâ€™m clear in my mind, and I think most people in England are, that itâ€™s not true,â€ the newly knighted Geoffrey Boycott told the Radio 4 Today programmeâ€™s Martha Kearney after assuring her that he couldnâ€™t â€œgive a toss, loveâ€ about those expressing concern at his 1998 conviction for domestic violence.How are ordinary people expected to understand when itâ€™s double-Dutch like this?â€ Ordinary no longer, Sir Geoffrey!Who is behind the thousands of positive and strikingly consistent messages from female fans appearing below posts on Boris Johnsonâ€™s Facebook page?"
"The Nuffield Trust charity calculates that creating new supply routes and the large amount of new paperwork and regulatory hurdles that a no deal Brexit would create for imports would cost around Â£2.3bn a year across the UK.Higher costs would risk shortages of generic medicines even if supply chains remain unbroken, as the National Audit Office reported happened in relation to price pressures in 2017.DHSC [the Department of Health and Social Care] is developing a multi-layered approach to mitigate these risks.â€â€œWhat level of mortality are you willing to accept in a no deal Brexit?â€ he asked MP and leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg on LBC radio.Rees-Mogg was unimpressed: â€œI donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any reason to suppose that a no deal Brexit should lead to an increased mortality rate.Rees-Mogg insisted there were â€œreserve plans to fly drugs in if necessaryâ€¦ I think itâ€™s deeply irresponsible of you to call in and try to spread fear across the country.The vicious smearing of whistleblowing doctors is common in the NHS, but those who try to take on this government can expect a whole new level of Brexit bile."
