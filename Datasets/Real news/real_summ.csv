"The 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule in China was ""one of Hong Kong's most violent and chaotic days"", the city's police chief has said.An 18-year-old protester was shot in the chest with a live bullet - one of six live rounds fired by police.Protesters - some armed with poles, petrol bombs and other projectiles - fought pitched battles with police in several parts of Hong Kong.In all police made 269 arrests, more than on any day since protests began.Those detained ranged in age from 12 to 71.The government said he was now in a stable condition.Although people have been shot with rubber bullets in previous protests, this was the first injury from a live round.Police chief Stephen Lo said firing the bullet was ""lawful and reasonable"" as the officer thought his and colleagues' lives were under threat.Asked why the bullet was fired at close range, Mr Lo said: ""He [the officer] did not decide the distance between him and the assailant.""Hundreds of people staged a peaceful sit-in outside the teenager's school on Wednesday.Meanwhile, 96 people, mostly students, who had been arrested on Sunday appeared in court charged with rioting.Repairs to shops, businesses and public facilities - including the mass transit system - are under way following Tuesday's violence.The day saw the highest number of arrests since this year's protests began, and the highest number of live rounds fired.The protests were sparked earlier this year by a proposed law, which would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland.Opponents thought this would put Hong Kongers at risk of unfair trials, and, in July, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the law ""was dead"".But despite the law being withdrawn, the protests have continued every weekend."
"North Korea may have fired a ballistic missile from a submarine, a move that came just hours after Pyongyang said it would resume nuclear talks with the US.South Korean officials said a missile launched near the port of Wonsan flew about 450km (280 miles) and reached an altitude of 910km, before landing in the Sea of Japan.If confirmed, this would be a significant escalation from the short-range tests it has conducted since May.The news sparked swift condemnation.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said it was a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions which ban North Korea from the use of ballistic missile technology.Just hours earlier, Pyongyang had said denuclearisation talks with Washington could finally resume later this week.North Korea had been developing submarine-launched ballistic missiles technology for some time before it halted all long-range missile testing.South Korea's National Security Council expressed concern about the test and said it was placing ""weight on the possibility"" that it was a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.The last SLBM tested by the North is thought to have taken place in August 2016, before President Trump even took office."
"And, to you, as the descendants of those killed, I offer my every sympathy, for I understand the pain does not diminish with time.""Campaigners say the damage inflicted by the British colonisation continues even now, with Maori communities suffering higher levels of deprivation.In a statement on its Facebook page, the Rongowhakaata Iwi Trust welcomed the British expression of regret.But it recalled that the crew had opened fire almost as soon as they landed, killing the local chief and others.""After only being here for two hours, Cook and his crew had trespassed, terrorised, killed and stolen from us.""Other Maori rights advocates have been critical of the low-key ceremony, which stopped short of an apology.Many have described as insensitive this weekend's anniversary events marking Captain Cook's arrival, which are expected to attract protests.They see him as an invader whose explorations, which helped chart the Pacific Ocean, also led to colonialism and traditional communities being destroyed.The UK has offered expressions of regret for actions that happened during colonial times in only a few instances.In May then Prime Minister Theresa May described the 1919 Amritsar massacre as a ""shameful scar"" on Britain's history in India."

"ï»¿There is a small, white plaque hidden away in the back streets of bustling Yokohama, so hard to find that even the man responsible for its creation has to ask for directions.That man is Mike Galbraith, a historian who has spent the past decade seeking to uncover the truth about Japan's rugby history.The plaque is modest in size but, with a rugby ball on top, it may attract a few fans as the World Cup final in the city's stadium draws closer.And within its inscription lies the seed of a remarkable story: one involving samurai, an armed cricket match and a long-running feud about the true origins of a sport now taking Japan by storm.A history graduate, he offered to contribute an article on the origins of Japanese rugby to the tour programme.Before he got on the case, the generally held belief was that rugby had been introduced to Japan in 1899 by two Cambridge graduates, Edward Bramwell Clarke and Ginnosuke Tanaka.But Galbraith found evidence that it had actually been played much earlier.An article dated 26 January 1866 speaks of a ""football"" club, as rugby was known then, founded in the port of Yokohama.That was five years before England's Rugby Football Union was founded and earlier than any known club in Wales came into existence.Thrilled to have achieved the historian's ultimate goal - finding a new source of evidence - Galbraith took his discovery of the Yokohama Foot Ball Club (YFBC) to the Japan Rugby Football Union (JRFU).Galbraith kept searching.He found a sketch of a match between English and Scottish expats living in Yokohama in a magazine published in 1874, three years after the first rugby international between the two national teams was played.As the word football was used to describe both modern-day football and rugby back then, some may question which sport the earlier articles were referring to.But there is no doubt about an 1873 article Galbraith uncovered in The Japan Weekly Mail which states someone ""caught the ball, made a good run through his opponents and, with a fine drop kick, scored a goal"".Surely that would be evidence enough to convince everyone rugby was played in Japan before 1899?The Yokohama Foot Ball Club was founded close to this spot on 26 January 1866.""It was unveiled by none other than JRFU president Shigetaka Mori, perhaps a sign that Galbraith's story is finally being accepted.As well as the plaque, an article he wrote on Japanese rugby history has been distributed to schools in Yokohama and 100,000 copies have been printed to be given out in the city's shops.So can Galbraith finally stop battling now?As we stroll back down the hill away from the Yokohama Country & Athletic Club, of which YFBC became a part in 1884, he shares a Japanese proverb with me.""çŸ³ã®ä¸Šã«ã‚‚ä¸‰å¹´"", which means ""three years sitting on a stone""."
"In his speech, Mr Johnson said no-deal was not an outcome the government was seeking, but ""it is an outcome for which we are ready"".On the eve of his speech, Mr Johnson told a conference fringe meeting, hosted by the DUP, that he hoped to reach a deal with the EU over the course of ""the next few days"".The issue of the Irish border - and how to keep it free from border checks when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU - has been a key sticking point in Brexit negotiations.Mr Johnson has said the solution reached by the EU and Theresa May, the backstop, is ""anti-democratic"" and ""inconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK"", claiming it offered no means for the UK to unilaterally exit and no say for the people of Northern Ireland over the rules that would apply there.The PM used his speech to confirm parts of his offer to the EU.He said that ""under no circumstances"" would there be checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland and the proposals would respect the peace process and the Good Friday agreement.It included promising ""a process of renewable democratic consent"" for the Stormont Assembly on its relationship with the EU going forward.He also referred to the use of technological solutions to ensure there was no hard border on the island of Ireland.He said he did not want a deal to be out of reach ""because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks when that technology is improving the whole time"".Mr Johnson also said he would ""protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border"".He added: ""At the same time we will allow the UK - whole and entire - to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start.""The PM said this would ""protect the union"".Echoing the main slogan of the conference, Mr Johnson said: ""Let's get Brexit done on 31 Octoberâ€¦to answer the cry of those 17.4 million who voted for Brexit [and] for those millions who may have voted Remain, but are first and foremost democrats and accept the result of the referendum.""He said the Tories were ""not an anti-European party"" and the UK is ""not an anti-European country"".The PM added: ""We love Europe.We are European.""But after 45 years of really dramatic constitutional change, we must have a new relationship with the EU.""Before Mr Johnson's speech, a European Commission spokeswoman said they would examine the proposals objectively, adding: ""We will listen carefully to the UK.""She said the EU wanted to agree a deal with the UK, saying ""an orderly withdrawal is far more preferable than a 'no-deal' scenario"".""[And] the no-deal turning ends in a very different place: a swamp that will slow the UK's every step for years to come."" The PM also used the opportunity to criticise Parliament, saying it ""refuses to deliver Brexit, refuses to do anything constructive and refuses to have an election"".He said: ""I am afraid that after three and a half years people are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools.""Mr Johnson said the Tories were ""the party of the NHS"" because of their belief in capitalism, adding: ""We understand the vital symmetry at the heart of the modern British economy between a dynamic enterprise culture and great public services precisely because we are the party of capitalism.""He praised London as its former mayor, but pledged to ""unlock talent in every corner of the UK"", and ensure safety with his existing policies of 20,000 additional police officers and tackling county lines gangs."
"ï»¿These are external links and will open in a new windowA London court has found that Â£35m ($42m) held in a UK bank account must go to the descendants of an Indian royal and not Pakistan.The 70-year-old dispute was over a 1948 transfer of Â£1m that the last Nizam (king) of Hyderabad made to a London bank account held by the then Pakistan High Commissioner.The judge ruled there was no evidence to back Pakistan's claims to the money.The origins of the dispute go back to the partitioning of British India.Hyderabad, which was a princely state, was annexed by India in 1948 in a military operation - the cash transfer had been made shortly before that."
"â€œHe sat down,â€ records Pyarelal, Gandhiâ€™s biographer, â€œfelt the pulse and fancied it was still beating feebly.â€ Pyarelal goes on to say that a doctor at hand, Dr. B.The two â€” Patel and Nehru â€” embraced, united in grief, as a shaken yet self-possessed Governor General Mountbatten watched.But why, why on earth, should we, on the anniversary, the sparklingly â€˜brightâ€™ 150th such, of Gandhiâ€™s birth be thinking of his death ?There is a reason: India and the world would have had little interest in the birth or the birth anniversary of this man if his life had not been what it was â€” a tussle between his passionate, self-consuming faith in ahimsa and his being stalked, unceasingly, by the fiercest violence until the very last step he took on the earth.And because something in many â€” not all, but very many â€” of us world-wide wants to feel the pulse, as Patel did that day on his wrist, of Gandhiâ€™s legacy today to see if it is beating, even if ever so feebly.Doctors of politics and history will tell us that it does not.Time now is not about that which makes history but that which makes headlines.Lincoln, as President of the United States of America spoke his 272 words at Gettysburg in 1863 as he did, and Gandhi, as an sedition-accused, at his Great Trial in Ahmedabad in 1922 as he did, not because they expected to make or â€˜breakâ€™ news but because they needed to, wanted to speak about political facts, civilisational verities, historical truths.When Lincoln rose to speak, Carl Sandburg, his biographer tells us, he took out from his coat pocket his notes, put on his steel eye-glasses, looked at the paper, put it back in his pocket and then made the speech that the world has not forgotten.Names and words like â€˜outsiderâ€™, â€˜infiltratorâ€™, â€˜illegal immigrantâ€™ are to be heard now in the same timbre and pitch in the worldâ€™s most advanced â€˜liberalâ€™ democracies as in its entrenched autocracies.Gandhiâ€™s legacy seems pulseless as the world moves from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to a Global Proclamation of Human Intolerance.Idealism has gone through a make-over, emerging from the green room of contemporary political fashion in the shape and style of a â€˜no-nonsenseâ€™ realism.Truth â€” Gandhiâ€™s obsession â€” is assailed today not by its â€˜good oldâ€™ opposite-number, untruth but by something else altogether, something that is so sinister as to make â€˜honest liesâ€™ look like a bored schoolboy.The dignity of the individual, equality between human beings and the quest for liberty are the foundational pillars of the Indian Constitutionâ€¦â€And when Pandit Jasraj, of a voice of divine fragrances, composes Om Allah Om in a moment of sheer inspiration to the entrancement of his audience and then goes on to sing it time and again to his and our rapture, our redemption.But most tellingly, and universally when the Archbishop of Canterbury visits India in this centenary year of Jallianwala Bagh and is so completely overwhelmed by Indiaâ€™s truth that he prostrates at the monument, to atone.There is in us Indians a Patel, too practical to be all â€˜idealsâ€™, but altogether too good to dismiss human values.When that Patel, real, not virtual , tries to feel the pulse of truth, provocation fails to inflame, propaganda fails to ignite, gullibility does not delude.And which is when the pulse revives of the man whose death has made his birth priceless, his legacy timeless.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Subscribe to The Hindu now and get unlimited access.Sign UpFind mobile-friendly version of articles from the day's newspaper in one easy-to-read list.Enjoy reading our articles without intrusion from advertisements.A select list of articles that match your interests and tastes.Move smoothly between articles as our pages load instantly.A one-stop-shop for seeing the latest updates, and managing your preferences.We brief you on the latest and most important developments, three times a day.*Our Digital Subscription plans do not currently include the e-paper or Android, iPhone, iPad mobile applications and print.Printable version | Oct 2, 2019 7:02:48 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mahatma-gandhi-the-pulse-of-a-legacy-in-an-age-of-heroics/article29567699.ece"
"Â  | Photo Credit: Raghuvir Srinivasan  Public sector Mahanadi Coalfields Limited on Tuesday said it suffered a loss of â‚¹2.68 crore when villagers staged an agitation demanding compensation for a goat that died after being hit by a coal-laden truck.The central PSU lodged a complaint with the local police for action against those who created an illegal obstruction.The coal transportation and dispatch work at Jagannath Sidings No. 1 and 2 in Talcher coalfields after residents from Chatia Hurtings village created ruckus and protested against death of a goat in an accident with a coal transportation tipper in the prohibited mining area, the MCL said.â€œJagannath sidings 1 and 2 were forcibly stopped by villagers at 11 am on Monday, demanding â‚¹60,000 compensation,â€ said Dikken Mehra, MCL spokesperson.â€œOperations could be resumed only after 2:30 pm following intervention of senior officials and police, and this three-and-a-half-hours illegal stoppage by the villagers caused an estimated loss of â‚¹1.4 crore on account of coal transportation to the sidings andâ‚¹1.28 crore on account of dispatch through railways,â€ said Mr. Mehra.Besides an estimated loss of â‚¹2.68 crore to MCL, the government exchequer also suffered an estimated loss to the tune of â‚¹46 lakh due to this unprecedented stoppage, he pointed out.According to MCL, while coal mines are restricted working zones where only people authorised, trained and with knowhow of the mines can enter and perform their job, the entry to mine areas is totally prohibited for general movement.â€œSome people from the peripheral localities deliberately trespass into the coal mine and overburden areas to pick coal, firewood and even make livestock graze, which is a cause of concern,â€ he said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Subscribe to The Hindu now and get unlimited access.Sign UpFind mobile-friendly version of articles from the day's newspaper in one easy-to-read list.Enjoy reading our articles without intrusion from advertisements.A select list of articles that match your interests and tastes.Move smoothly between articles as our pages load instantly.A one-stop-shop for seeing the latest updates, and managing your preferences.We brief you on the latest and most important developments, three times a day.*Our Digital Subscription plans do not currently include the e-paper or Android, iPhone, iPad mobile applications and print.Sign UpSupport The Hindu's new online experience with zero ads.Already a user?"

"Â  Dealing a blow to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis days before the Assembly election, the Supreme Court on Tuesday directed that he face trial for suppressing information in his 2014 election documents about two forgery and criminal defamation cases pending in a Nagpur court.A Bench of Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose ordered the trial court to continue with the case against Mr. Fadnavis under Section125-A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.Â The decision came on an appeal filed by Satish Ukey, a lawyer, against a Bombay High Court decision.The judgment by Chief Justice Gogoi held that a â€œcontesting candidate is mandated to furnish information concerning the cases in which a Competent Court has taken cognisance, along with the cases in which charges have been framed.â€ The court interpreted Section 33-A of the 1951 Act to hold that â€˜informationâ€™ to be disclosed by a candidate includes cases of which a court has already taken cognisance.It held that the election affidavit under Form 26 of the Conduct of Election Rules of 1961, submitted to the poll officer along with the nomination papers, should detail not only cases in which charges had been filed but also those which had been taken cognisance of.â€œThere is no element of doubt that, subsequent to the substitution of Form 26 in 2012, the new Form 26 (as in vogue at the time of the elections in 2014), mandates the disclosure of information by the contesting candidate of not only case(s) in which charges have been framed but also case(s) in which cognisance has been taken by the court,â€ the judgment said.Chief Justice Gogoi, writing for the Bench, observed that a bare perusal of Form-26 â€œmandates disclosure of information by the contesting candidate regarding cases that are pending against him in which cognisance has been taken by the court.â€Trouble began for Mr. Fadnavis when Mr. Ukay filed a criminal complaint before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Nagpur, for registration of a case against him under Section 125-A of the 1951 Act.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Subscribe to The Hindu now and get unlimited access.Printable version | Oct 2, 2019 6:40:45 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/elections/maharashtra-assembly/devendra-fadnavis-to-face-trial-for-suppressing-pendency-of-criminal-cases-in-poll-affidavit-sc/article29564520.ece"
"The Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) are closely watching the unrest unfolding in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena after the parties decided their seat distribution.A senior Congress leader said, â€œThere are around 30 seats where the ruling alliance is set to face major unrest.We are in touch with them, and you will see a few interesting developments in the last two days before the deadline to file nominations.â€ The Opposition parties, meanwhile, will meet on Wednesday for the last time to sort out differences on a few disputed seats, before a press conference to formally announce the alliance.After the Sena-BJP finalised the seat-sharing pact on Tuesday morning, reports started pouring in of possible rebellion within each of the saffron parties.In Kalyan West, it was BJP workers who expressed discontent over MLA Narendra Pawar being denied a ticket and the seat being given to the Sena.In Mumbai, the Wadala Assembly segment has gone to the BJP, where Senaâ€™s Shraddha Jadhav was preparing to contest for the last five years.Meanwhile, though the NCP has not officially released its candidate list, its senior leaders such as State president Jayant Patil from Islampur in Sangli, three-term MLA Rahul Mote from Bhoom-Paranda in Osmanabad, Shekhar Nikam from Chiplun, Pramod Hindurao from Murbad, Anil Patil from Amalner and Jagdish Valvi from Chopda filed their nomination forms on Tuesday.According to NCP leaders, tapping into the unrest within the ruling alliance is one of the reasons for not releasing the candidate list.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Subscribe to The Hindu now and get unlimited access."
"Johnson & Johnson said on Tuesday it will pay $20.4 million to settle claims by two Ohio counties, allowing the U.S. healthcare giant to avoid an upcoming federal trial seeking to hold the industry responsible for the nation's opioid epidemic.J&J became the fourth drugmaker to settle claims ahead of the Federal Court trial against multiple manufacturers and distributors in Cleveland scheduled for later this month.The case is considered a bellwether for more than 2,600 lawsuits by state and local governments that are pending nationally.â€œThe settlement allows the company to avoid the resource demands and uncertainty of a trial as it continues to seek meaningful progress in addressing the nation's opioid crisis,â€ J&J said in a statement.â€œThe company recognizes the opioid crisis is a complex public health challenge and is working collaboratively to help communities and people in need,â€ it added.Opioids were involved in 400,000 overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.J&J which formerly marketed the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, said the settlement includes no admission of liability.The company will pay $10 million to Cuyahoga and Summit counties, reimburse $5 million of their legal and other expenses and provide $5.4 million to non-profit organizations that run opioid-related programs in the counties.Mallinckrodt Plc finalized a $24 million settlement with the same two counties on Monday.Endo International Plc and Allergan Plc also settled with the two counties in August to avoid going to trial.The remaining defendants in the Oct. 21 federal trial include McKesson Corp, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd , Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Henry Schein Inc.OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP succumbed to pressure from the lawsuits and filed for bankruptcy protection in September.Some plaintiffs' lawyers have compared the opioid cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998.Earlier in the year, an Oklahoma judge ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers.Purdue Pharma and Teva had settled claims by Oklahomas attorney general for $270 million and $85 million, respectively.Printable version | Oct 2, 2019 6:15:37 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/johnson-johnson-pays-204-million-to-settle-ohio-opioid-case-lawsuits/article29572949.ece"
"Because he viewed himself as a sanatani, an adherent of a way of life that started long, long ago but, unlike the ancient that is dead and gone, continues to live today.Central to this seemingly everlasting Hindu imagination is its deep plurality, reflected in its acceptance of the co-existence of three basic ethical forms: one dependent on multiple gods and goddesses, one on a single god, and one even entirely independent of god, gods and goddesses (truth-seeking).â€œWhile I believe myself to be a Hindu, I know that I do not worship God in the same manner as any one or all of them.â€Given the inescapability of deep religious diversity, he argued, â€œthe need of the moment is not one religion for the whole of human kind, but mutual respect, equal regard and tolerance of the devotees of different religions.â€ This moral-practical attitude of equal regard for all religions is entailed by an epistemic grasp of the deeper, more fundamental unity of all religions.â€œAll religions are true and all have some error in them and that whilst I hold by my own, I should hold others as dear as Hinduism and make no distinction between them.â€Gandhiâ€™s inclusive (belief in one God that encompasses all gods) rather than exclusive (belief in only one True God, while holding all others as false) monotheism flows directly from Indian â€˜polytheisticâ€™ traditions, a trait they share with other religious traditions of the ancient world (Greek, Latin, Pre-Islamic Arab religions).The implicit theology of these religions allows for translation of gods.Also read: What would Gandhi say about the Indian media?In virtually all cultures of classical antiquity, each god performed a function based on his cosmic competence â€” gods of love, war, knowledge, or craftsmanship.This is a theology of recognition in which the gods and goddesses of each culture are recognised within the background of a common semantic universe.One feature of inclusive monotheism then is that â€œall worship the same God although under different namesâ€.If different names refer to the same god, then why not embrace all?Also read: Gandhi has not spoken his last wordTwo more things follow.First, â€œto revile one anotherâ€™s religion, to make reckless statements, to utter untruth, to break the heads of innocent men, to desecrate temples or mosques is a denial of God.â€ Second, â€œit is wrong for anyone to say that his God is superior to that of anotherâ€™s.â€œWhat is the use of crossing from one compartment to another, if it does not mean a moral enhancement?â€For Gandhi, respect and toleration were related, and virtually indistinguishable.This is hate-based toleration â€” I hate but still tolerate.Also read: Gandhi and the GitaGandhiâ€™s â€˜tolerationâ€™ is different.This is Gandhiâ€™s love-based toleration, entirely consistent with respect.Unlike the mainstream, hate-based conception of toleration that presupposes that oneness with significant others is achieved by abolishing the radical other, by eliminating plurality, for this second, Gandhian conception, oneness is attained by accepting all radical others as equally significant because they variously manifest one supreme being.Is it not time that we challenge the idea of religion as an exclusive monolith, one for which the highest achievable social ideal is an opportunist, morally dubious hate-based toleration and recover the deep pluralism and love-based toleration at the heart of Gandhiâ€™s religious vision?"

"So the PM is talking about the past,â€ said Mr. Jaishankar denying the allegation that the PM was campaigning for Mr. Trump.What did Mr. Modi say?And his celebration of Deepavali in the House â€” White House â€” lit up millions of faces with joy and appreciation,â€ he had said.Abki baar Modi sarkar was Mr. Modiâ€™s 2014 campaign slogan that a Hindutva group in the U.S. had repurposed for Mr. Trump, who made a short campaign ad with himself uttering the Hindi slogan.Congress calls out Modiâ€™s endorsement of Trump Mr. Jaishankar is right in saying that media reporting, and the response of the Opposition, largely misinterpreted Mr. Modiâ€™s comment.Whether or not Mr. Modiâ€™s speech and the rally amounted to involvement in U.S. politics is a question that requires some explanation, but the answer can only be in the affirmative.â€œWe have a very nonpartisan (approach to domestic U.S. politics).They want American politicians to be pro-India, and anti-Pakistan on all questions, regardless of American interests.This amounts to Mr. Modiâ€™s diaspora politics trying to tilt the scale in favour of Mr. Trump and against the Democrats.In all this, has the Houston rally tilted Mr. Trump in Indiaâ€™s favour?Mr. Trump has no sympathy for human rights, democracy, etc and he personally is unlikely to raise such questions regarding India.Mr. Modiâ€™s effusive praise, for sure, warmed the cockles of Mr. Trumpâ€™s heart but some bruises in his ego will likely surface.We donâ€™t know yet, but knowing Mr. Trump, we might get to know at some point.â€œMr. President, you had introduced me to your family in 2017 and today I have the honor to introduce you to my family, over a billion Indians and people of Indian heritage around the globe,â€ Mr. Modi said, introducing Mr. Trump.â€œHeâ€™s brought India together, weâ€™ll call him the Father of India,â€ Mr. Trump said three days later, about Mr. Modi.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Subscribe to The Hindu now and get unlimited access."
